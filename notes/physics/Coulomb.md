The coulomb is the SI unit of electrical charge, and is defined (in relation to the [[Ampere]]) as approximately $6\,241\,509\,074\,460\,762\,608$ [[elementary charge]]s.

$$
\begin{align}
1\ C &= \frac{1}{1.602176634\times10^{-19}}e \\
\\
1\ C &\approx 6.242 \times 10^{18}e
\end{align}
$$

It is also the amount of charge that moves through one [[Ampere]] over 1 [[Second]]
$$
C = A \cdot s
