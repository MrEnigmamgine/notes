The second is a unit of time defined in 1967 as "the duration of 9 192 631 770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the Cesium-133 atom". This concept is known as the [[Cesium Standard]].

$$
1 \:\text{second} = 1\,s = 9\,192\,631\,770\,{{\Delta t} _{Cs}}  
$$

Where ${{\Delta t} _C} _s$ refers to the time it takes for a Cesium-133 atom to transition between two hyperfine ground states.
