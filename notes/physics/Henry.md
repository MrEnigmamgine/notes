The henry, symbol H, is the SI coherent derived unit of electrical inductance. One henry is the inductance of an electric circuit when an electric current, that is changing at one [[ampere]] per [[second]], results in an [[Electromotive force]] of one [[volt]] across the inductor.

$$
\begin{align*}
1\ H &= 1\ \frac{Wb}{A}\\
\text{or}\\
1\ H &= 1\ \frac{Vs}{A}
\end{align*}
$$

The henry can also be expressed with [[Lenz's law]] by solving for $L$, which is measured in henries.
$$
L = \frac{\varepsilon}{\frac{di}{dt}}
$$


The henry can also be expressed as a function of the physical parameters of an inductor:

$$
L = \frac{N^{2} \mu A}{l}
$$
