The meter is a unit of [[Distance]]

- **Previous definition:** The metre is the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of $\frac{1}{299\,792\,458}$ of a second.
- **2019 definition:** The metre, symbol m, is the SI unit of length. It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the speed of light in vacuum c to be 299_792_458 when expressed in the unit m⋅s<sup>−1</sup>, where the second is defined in terms of the Caesium frequency ${\Delta \nu}_{Cs}$.

The metre may be expressed directly in terms of the defining constants:

$$ 1 {m} = \frac{c}{{{\Delta \nu} _C} _s} = c \times \frac{1}{299\,792\,458}s$$
