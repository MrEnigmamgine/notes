A kilogram is defined as the mass of $1.4755214 \times 10^{40}$ photons at the frequency of the [[Cesium Standard]].

This definition is derived by the blending of two of the most famous equations in physics:
$$ E = mc^2 $$
and
$$ E = h\nu $$

This works because we can solve for mass ($m$) and substituting $E$ with $h\nu$.  Furthermore, using ${{\Delta \nu} _{Cs}}$ , the frequency of the [[Cesium Standard]] as $\nu$, the resulting equation becomes:
$$
m = \frac{h{{\Delta \nu} _{Cs}}}{c^2}
$$
