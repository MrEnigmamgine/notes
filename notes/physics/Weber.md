The weber is a unit of [[magnetic flux]]. It can be defined in terms of [[Faraday's Law]], which observes that a change in flux of one weber per [[Second]] will induce one [[Volt]] of potential.

$$
1V = 1 \frac{Wb}{s}
$$
More traditionally, one weber is the magnetic flux that, linking a circuit of one turn, would produce in it an electromotive force of one volt if it were reduced to zero at a uniform rate in one second.

Therefore

$$
1\ Wb = 1 V s
$$

Expressed in SI base units:
$$
1 Wb = 1 \frac{kg\ m^{2}}{A\ s^{2}}
$$
