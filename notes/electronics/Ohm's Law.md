Ohm's law states that the electric current through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points. Introducing the constant of proportionality, the resistance, one arrives at the three mathematical equations used to describe this relationship:

$$\begin{align*}
V&=IR\\
\\
\text{or}\\
\\
I&=\frac{V}{R}\\
\\
\text{or}\\
\\
R&=V/I
\end{align*}
$$
Where _I_ is the current through the conductor, _V_ is the voltage measured _across_ the conductor and _R_ is the [resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance "Electrical resistance") of the conductor.

In physics, the term _Ohm's law_ is also used to refer to various generalizations of the law; for example the [vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(mathematics_and_physics) "Vector (mathematics and physics)") form of the law used in [electromagnetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetics "Electromagnetics") and material science:

$$
J=\sigma E
$$

where **J** is the [current density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_density "Current density") at a given location in a resistive material, **E** is the electric field at that location, and _σ_ ([sigma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigma "Sigma")) is a material-dependent parameter called the [conductivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_conductivity "Electrical conductivity"). This reformulation of Ohm's law is due to [Gustav Kirchhoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav_Kirchhoff "Gustav Kirchhoff").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm%27s_law#cite_note-5)
