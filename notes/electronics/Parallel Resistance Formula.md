$$
{R_{t}} = \left({\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{R_{i}}}\right)^{-1}
$$
Or
$$
\frac{1}{R_{t}} = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{R_{i}}
$$
Or
$$
R_{t} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{R_{1}} + \frac{1}{R_{2}} , 
\dots + \frac{1}{R_{n}}}
$$

This formula is very similar to the formula for [[Harmonic Mean]] with the key difference being that a harmonic mean of the resistances will result in $n \cdot R_{t}$ so by dividing the harmonic mean by the number of resistors you will get the total resistance of a parallel circuit.
$$R_{t}= \frac{\text{Harmonic Mean}}{\text{Count}}$$


This formula derives from [[Kirchoff's laws]] which states that the current entering a loop is equivalent to the current exiting a loop. Or, if you consider the current flowing through each branch, the sum of the currents will be the same as the amount of current supplied to the circuit.
$$
I_{t} = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} I_{i}
$$
