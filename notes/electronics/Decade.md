A decade is a 10x increase in a frequency.  For example, one decade away from 15 Hz would be 150 Hz. Two decades would be 1500 Hz, and so on.

This term is used when describing the behaviors of frequency filters. The useful thing to know is that for each decade from a [[critical frequency]], the output voltage will decrease by 20 [[Decibel|dB]].
