### Summative Properties of Inductance

##### In Series
Similar to [[Series Resistance Formula]]:
$$
L_t = \sum_{i=1}^{n}L_i
$$
##### In Parallel
Similar to [[Parallel Resistance Formula]]
$$
{L_{t}} = \left({\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{L_{i}}}\right)^{-1}
$$

### Summative properties of Reactance and Resistance

When Inductive reactance is in series with a resistance, the cumulative effect is called [[Impedance]], and is expressed as a [[complex number]] where the vector angle represents the time dimension.
