First described in 1845 by German physicist Gustav Kirchhoff, Kirchoff's circuit laws describe the equilibriums in current and voltage of electric circuits.

### Kirchoff's Current Law

Also known as **Kirchoff's First Law** or **Kirchoff's Junction Rule**, this law states that the sum of the currents entering a node is equal to the sums of the currents leaving the node. Algebraically this can be expressed as:
$$
\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n}I_{k}=0
$$
Where $n$ is the number of branches connected to the node and $I$ represents the current flowing through a particular branch, recalling that current is a signed ($\pm$)
