Capacitance, measured in [[Farads]] refers to the storage of electrical charge.

### Summative properties of capacitance

#### In series
Similar to [[Parallel Resistance Formula]]
$$
{C_{t}} = \left({\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{C_{i}}}\right)^{-1}
$$
#### In parallel
Similar to [[Series Resistance Formula]]
$$
C_t = \sum_{i=1}^{n}C_i
$$


### Storage of Charge and Energy

Capacitors store [[Coulomb|charge]] :
$$
C = \frac{Q}{V}
$$

| Where | is |
| ---- | ---- |
| $C$ | Capacitance in Farads |
| $Q$ | Charge in Coloumbs |
| $V$ | Voltage in Volts |



Capacitors store [[Joule|energy]] :
$$
E = \frac{1}{2}CV^{2}
$$

| Where | is |
| ---- | ---- |
| $W$ | Energy in Joules |
| $C$ | Capacitance in Farads |
| $V$ | Voltage in Volts |
