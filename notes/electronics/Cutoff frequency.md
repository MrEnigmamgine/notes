In passive filters, the cutoff frequency, or *critical frequency*, occurs when the output voltage is $\frac{1}{\sqrt2}$ the maximum.

Coincidentally, this occurs when the reactance and resistance are equal to each other.

## Capacitor filters
$$
f_{c}= \frac{1}{2\pi RC}
$$

## Inductor filters
$$
f_{c}= \frac{R}{2\pi L}
$$
or
$$
f_{c}= \frac{1}{{2\pi (L/R)}}
$$
