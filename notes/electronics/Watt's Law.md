Watt's law **defines the relationship between power, voltage and current and states that the power in a circuit is a product of the voltage and the current**. There are many practical applications of Watt's law, and the formula to calculate Watt's Law is P = IV.

$$
\text{Power} = \text{Current} \times \text{Voltage}
$$

Where:

Variable | Unit | Symbol 
--|--|--
Power | Watts | W 
Current | Amperes | A
Voltage | Volts | V
