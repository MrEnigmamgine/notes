In electronics, the decibel is a function of the ratio between input and output.

Most commonly it expresses differences in power (watts) and voltage (volts).

$$
dB = 10 \log\left(\frac{P_{out}}{P_{in}}\right)
$$
$$
dB = 20 \log\left(\frac{V_{out}}{V_{in}}\right)
$$
The coefficient for power and voltage changes because of watt's law where $P = \frac{V^{2}}{R}$.

We take the log of the ratio so that the value is normalized to 1 (all values will be between 0 and 1). Therefore a decibel is a measure of *change* and is referred to as **gain**.
