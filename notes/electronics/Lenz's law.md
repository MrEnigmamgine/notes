Lenz’s law states that the direction of an induced [[Electromotive force|EMF]] is such that it will oppose the change that is causing it. In other words, the direction of an induced current will oppose the motion or change which caused the induced current. The induced voltage is described as a “back EMF” or [[Inductive Reactance]]. The back EMF is proportional to the rate of change in a current.

$$
\varepsilon \propto \frac{di}{dt}
$$
Expressed in coherent SI units, the proportionality constant $L$ (inductance) is introduced, and is measured in [[Henry|henries]]. By convention, $L$ is treated as negative to indicate that the back EMF opposes the current.

$$
\varepsilon = -L\frac{di}{dt}
$$

Where:

Symbol | Meaning | Unit
--|--|--
$\varepsilon$ | Back EMF | V |
$L$ | Inductance | H |
$\frac{di}{dt}$ | Change in current | A/s |


### Mechanical analogy
Inductance in a circuit is analogous to the mass in a mechanical system:

| Electrical system | Mechanical system |
| ----------------- | ----------------- |
| $\varepsilon = -L\frac{di}{dt}$ | $F = m\frac{dv}{dt}$ |

|system|cause of change|resistance to change|rate of change|
|---|---|---|---|
|electrical|ℰ|–_L_|$di⁄dt$|
|mechanical|_F_ | _m_|$dv⁄dt$|
