### RL Lead circuit
When a resistance and inductance are in series with each other, a [[voltage divider]] is formed.

The voltage across the inductor "leads" the source voltage by an angle derived from the circuit's [[Impedance]].
$$
\phi = 90^{\circ} - \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{X_{L}}{R}\right)
$$
or
$$
\phi = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{R}{X_{L}}\right)
$$
