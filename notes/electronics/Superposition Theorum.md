The Superposition Theorum states that The current or voltage in any given branch of a multiple-source linear circuit can be found by determining the current or voltage in that particular branch produced by each source acting independently with all other sources replaced by their internal resistances. The total current or voltage for the branch is the algebraic sum of the responses in that branch.
