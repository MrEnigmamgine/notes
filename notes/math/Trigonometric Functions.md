The trigonometric functions consists of:

 - [[Sine and Cosine]]
 - [[Tangent and Cotangent]]
 - [[Secant and Cosecant]]

The functions that start with "Co" in their name are called the "complementary" functions, and are the same as their counterparts except that they are in respect to the *complementary* angle.

### Inverse functions

Understanding the [[SOHCAHTOA]] relationships is especially useful when applying the inverse functions.  Where the normal functions ask "What number do I get with this angle?", the inverse functions ask "What angle gives me this number?".

For example, in the image above, if we are given the X,Y coordinates of point B, we can easily determine the angle from the origin using the inverse tangent.
$$
\alpha = \tan^{-1}(Y/X)
$$
We can also find the hypotenuse (or magnitude) $h$ by applying the Pythagorean theorem to the same coordinates.
$$
h = \sqrt{Y^{2}+X^{2}}
$$
