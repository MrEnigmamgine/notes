Sine and Cosine are geometric functions of angles ( $\angle$ ). They represent the height and width (respectively) of a triangle with a given angle ($\alpha$, sometimes $\theta$).

Consequently, if given the length of the hypotenuse which is treated as the length of a radius in a circle, then the sine and cosine functions become very useful for describing points on the circumference of a circle.

> Note: The graph of cosine is the same as sine, but offset by $\frac{1}{2}\pi$ ($90^{\circ}$ )

### Graphing

Similar to how a linear graph can be transformed by manipulating the variables of $y=mx+b$ , sine waves can be manipulated by adjusting the variables of the following equation:

$$
\mathcal{f}(\theta) = A \sin(\omega \theta + \varphi)
$$
Where:

Symbol | Meaning | Effect 
--|--|--
$A$ | Amplitude | Stretches vertically |
$\omega$ | Frequency | Squishes horizontally|
$\varphi$| Offset | Shifts horizontally |
$\theta$ | Angle | |
