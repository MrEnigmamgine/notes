The speed of light in [vacuum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum "Vacuum") is defined to be exactly 299 792 458 [[Meter|Meters]] per [[Second]].

$$\begin{equation}
c = 299\,792\,458\, m/s
\end{equation}
$$

The fixed value of the speed of light in SI units results from the fact that the metre is now defined in terms of the speed of light. All forms of electromagnetic radiation move at exactly this same speed in vacuum.
