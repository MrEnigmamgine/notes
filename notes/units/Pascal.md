One pascal is defined as the pressure exerted by a perpendicular force of one [[newton]] on an area of one [[Meter|square meter]].

$$
1Pa = \frac{1N}{1m^2}
$$

## Energy density
A system under pressure has the potential to perform work on its surroundings. As such, pressure is a measure of potential energy ([[Joule]]) per unit volume, or energy density. It can be seen that energy density is dimensionally equivalent to pressure.


$$
p = \frac{F*d}{A*d} = \frac{E}{V}
$$
$$
1Pa = \frac{1J}{1m^3}
$$
where:

$p$ is the pressure in pascals, symbol Pa,
$F$ is the force applied in newtons, symbol N,
$A$ is the area in square metres, symbol m2,
$E$ is the potential energy in joules, symbol J,
$V$ is the volume in cubic metres, symbol m3.
