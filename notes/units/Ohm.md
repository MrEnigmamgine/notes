One ohm is defined as the electrical resistance between two points of a conductor when a constant potential difference of one volt, applied to these points, produces in the conductor a current of one ampere, the conductor not being the seat of any electromotive force.

$$
1\Omega = 1 \frac{V}{A}
$$
When expressed purely in base SI units:

$$
1\Omega = kg\, m^{2}\,s^{-3}\, A^{-2}
$$
