One volt is defined, via [[Watt's Law]], as the difference in electric potential between two points of a conducting wire when an electric current of one [[Ampere]] dissipates one [[Watt]] of power between those points.

$$
1\ V = \frac{1W}{1A}
$$

Because watts and amps are derived units, this can also be expressed in terms of [[Joule]]s and [[Coulomb]]s.
$$\begin{align*}
1\ V &= \frac{1\frac{J}{s}}{1 \frac{C}{s}}\\
\\
1\ V &= 1\frac{J}{C}\\
\end{align*}
