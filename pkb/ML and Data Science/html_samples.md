 <strong>Caution!</strong> <br>
  Models trained on biased data will reflect the bias of the humans that labeled it.  <br>
  Because this data was created by a small group, there is a high risk of bias.

**Heads Up!**  
The order of the results of a query are not implicitly ordered, so if you're paging, make sure you provide an [`$order` clause](https://dev.socrata.com/docs/queries/) or at a minimum `$order=:id`.  
That will guarantee that the order of your results will be stable as you page through the dataset.
